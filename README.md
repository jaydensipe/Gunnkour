# ðŸ”« Gunnkour ðŸ”«

Gunnkour was the first game I've ever made. It was made using the Godot game engine in GDScript. It is a platformer game that uses gun physics to propel you to make longer jumps. This game taught me a huge amount about the game development process from start to finish. It was my first real time attempting to create something in the form of a game, using what I learned in school and applied it to the game development process.

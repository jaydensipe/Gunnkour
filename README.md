# ðŸ”« Gunnkour ðŸ”«

Gunnkour is the first game I've ever made. It was made using the Godot game engine in GDScript. It is a platformer game that uses gun physics to propel you to make longer jumps. This particular game game taught me a huge amount about the game development process from start to finish. It was my first real time attempting to create something in the form of a game, using what I learned in school to apply to game development.
